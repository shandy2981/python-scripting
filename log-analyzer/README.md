<h2>Scenario:</h2>
Python script that analyzes server log files to identify the top IP addresses that have made requests. 
This script manages log files that are large, so it should handle them efficiently.

<h3>Requirements:</h3>
1. The tool should accept the path to a log file as an argument.
2. An optional argument should allow the user to specify the number of top IP addresses to display (default to 10).
3. An optional flag should be provided to display the output in JSON format.
